    "Exercise 3: stretching\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the reporting function above, we can create a function that stretches the molecule, by simply moving one of the \"fixed\" atoms by a\n",
    "small amount, thus increasing the distance between our \"fixed\" atoms. Write a function that:\n",
    "- calculates the distance between the atoms,\n",
    "- calculate the new position of one of the fixed atoms, so that it is slightly further away\n",
    "- sets that new position for your fixed atom\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. attach this function to the dynamics object (you can attach multiple functions to a dynamics object), and call it frequently, so the stretching is \"continuous\"\n",
    "1. run the dynamics for a set number of steps, then call your function, and run the dynamics again for a set number of steps, etc. you can either call your stretching\n",
    "function \"by hand\", outside the dynamics run, or attach your function to the dynamics but only have it be called very infrequently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, if you choose method 1 the stretch amount has to be much much smaller than in method 2 for an equivalent overall stretch rate, because it is being applied much more frequently. \n",
    "Test your setup by running a short dynamics. Initially, make the distance adjustments frequent and large (e.g. 2%) so that you can see that it is being done correctly by inspecting your short trajectory in Ovito. "
